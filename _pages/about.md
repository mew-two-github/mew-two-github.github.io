I am a final year MS student in Operations Research in the [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) Department at Georgia Tech, Atlanta. I am currently working with [Prof. Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/).

I am interested in working on stochastic modeling, queueing theory and reinforcement learning algorithms with applications to resource allocation and online platforms. I completed a B.Tech with honors in Chemical Engineering and a Minor in System Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.

* <b>Sivaraman, V.</b>, Kurapati, R., & Natarajan, U. (2024). Solvation-free energy of uncharged and charged water-soluble synthetic
polymer using adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann solver: poly(acrylic acid). [Molecular Simulation, 1â€“10](https://doi.org/10.1080/08927022.2024.2439623).

Application of faster methods based on Poisson-Boltzmann model of electrostatics to calculate the solvation energy for a dilute solution of Polyacryclic acid, a synthetic polymer. Reports a crossover of variation of total solvation energy for SASA (Solvent Accessible Surface Area) and SAV (Solvent Accessible Volume) from one scaling to the other seen only for hydrophobic solutes before.

Working with Prof. Siva Theja Maguluri on Spatial Matching of Dynamic Two-Sided Queues. The [previous work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02213) showed the near-optimality of max-weight algorithm for matching. Working on modifying the max-weight algorithm when we incorporate distances in the system to ensure it is stable (queue sizes do not go to infinity) and show its optimality. Performed simulations to see the algorithm's performance under high traffic for different systems and compared it with the performance of a baseline algorithm.
